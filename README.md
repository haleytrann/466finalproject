## idea
- NEURAL NETWORK!!
  - start off with one hidden layer (may expand, optimize) 
  - decide on features to use / number of neurons on each layer
    - number of features = number of neurons on input layer
  - 56? inputs / 1 output
  - e-mail is considered spam (1) or not spam (0) -- leave it same in NN

- use our own emails (extra)


## split up work
- read in / parse the data (anna)
- research NN (how to split up, steps in Java, etc.)
