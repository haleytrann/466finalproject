# 466finalproject

## idea
- NEURAL NETWORK!!
  - start off with one hidden layer (may expand, optimize) 
  - decide on features to use / number of neurons on each layer
    - number of features = number of neurons on input layer
  - 56? inputs / 1 output
  - e-mail is considered spam (1) or not spam (0) -- leave it same in NN


## split up work
- read in / parse the data (anna)
- research NN (how to split up, steps in Java, etc.)


## todo!!
- add more layers
- finish training method?
- add more testing metrics (edit accuracy, precision, recall, etc?)
- use our own emails (extra)

- slides!!
